# Turtle-Race-Game
This is a simple Python program for a turtle race game. You can use this code to set up a fun game where different colored turtles race, and the user can bet on their favorite color to win the race.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get the code up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

To run this code, you need to have Python and the Turtle graphics library installed. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installing

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the Python script directly from this page.

2. Make sure you have the `turtle` library, which is usually included with Python by default.

## Usage

1. Open the Python script in your preferred code editor.

2. Run the script.

3. A window will appear, and a dialog box will ask you to choose a color to bet on for the turtle race. Enter one of the following color choices: "red," "yellow," "orange," "blue," "green," or "black."

4. The turtles will start racing to reach the right edge of the window. The first turtle to reach the finish line will be declared the winner.

5. If your chosen color turtle wins, you'll receive a message that you've won. Otherwise, you'll receive a message that you've lost.

6. Close the window when you're done by clicking on it.

## Code Explanation

The code consists of a Python script that uses the `turtle` library for creating a race between turtles of different colors. Here's a brief explanation of the code:

- It creates a window using the `turtle.Screen()` class.
- It asks the user to choose a color to bet on.
- Turtles of different colors are created and positioned at the starting line.
- The turtles move forward by a random amount in each step, simulating the race.
- When one of the turtles crosses the finish line, the game ends, and the result is displayed.

Feel free to modify and improve the code as you see fit. Have fun with your turtle race game!
